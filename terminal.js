            </br>I am in my fifth year in "Master's Programme in Computer and Information Engineering" at Uppsala University and currently on an exchange year at Robert Gordon university in Aberdeen, Scotland. I will return to Sweden for the summer 2020 and are therefore looking for a suitable Internship to gain more experience. During my first year on my masters, which I had in Uppsala, I focused on Software Engineering, but during my exchange I've taken courses more within the field of Cybersecurity and Network Engineering. Since these are subjects that I really find interesting as well.</br></br>
            I am really interested in a lot of different branches of IT, which is why I'm not completely sure what I would like to work with after graduation. Fields which I would like to try work in would be Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Science or Cybersecurity. If it somehow could be combined, that would be excellent. I think the position you're advertising for would be rewarding both in a sense of new experiences but also it might help me become a bit more certain about what I want to do later on.</br></br>
            If I were to name three of my best qualities I would say Team Player, Fast Learner and a Problem Solver. I've been playing team-sports since I was a kid and I think I have projected that upon work I've done in group projects both in School and at employments. Fast learner, for example in situations at earlier employments I've had to learn new programming languages, understand code-bases and systems quickly. When it has been demanded of me, I can pick up on new knowledge fast. Problem solver, I believe that one of the most important and fundamental things we learn in my studies at University is problem solving. It is also something that I really enjoy doing. For example in the month of December I did a Cybersecurity challenge where you were supposed to solve a problem each day for 25 days. I managed to finish the challenge with every problem resolved. That is mainly because I find problem solving very fun, but also because I am stubborn in a sense that I don't give up until I solved it.</br></br>
